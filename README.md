### ðŸŒ± Alize Lee

Junior Full Stack Developer in Stockholm. Having completed 9-weeks intensive web development course in Le Wagon Stockholm, batch #486. 

Start using Pomodor timer when code... I have to eat and drink to remain as a human being. 

### Goals as a coder

I love feeling proud & satisfaction when I've done my job. Sometimes it keeps me work stretching beyond office hours. I want to code super clean like a master. I want to be able to provide my work as a good example in the future!

### Learning is fun!

I am an enthusiastic learner, a curious explorer and an improvisor. I always try to be the best version of myself and be better than yesterday. I am intrigued with new challenges, motivated by its requirements. It's awesome that I can keep learning while working!
